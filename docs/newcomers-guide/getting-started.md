## Requirements

Before starting to use Gaijin Application Platform (GAP), please make sure that:

- **You have an active account at** [https://login.gaijin.net](https://login.gaijin.net/)

  If you don’t have any account, please create one.

  If you have already been playing one of Gaijin’s games, your gaming account should suffice, however, for security considerations, it would be better if you used a separate account for development purposes.

  :::note

  If your email service supports subaddressing, we recommend using that mechanism for creating multiple accounts linked to the same email address.

  Let’s say you already have a gaming account with the registered email address `jsmith@test.com`. You can create additional accounts according to the pattern `jsmith+***@test.com` with any sequence of symbols in place of the asterisks that is allowed for email addresses. In this case, a separate, fully independent account will be created, but all correspondence will go to the address `jsmith@test.com`.

  This way you can create both accounts for development and administration as well as accounts for test profiles. For instance, `jsmith+dev@test.com`, `jsmith++test1@test.com`, `jsmith++test2@test.com` and so on.

  :::

- **TOTP two-factor authentication has been enabled for your account.**

  Go to [security settings](https://login.gaijin.net/ru/profile/settings/security) and make sure that two-factor authentication has been enabled and configured.
